# Intro to Data Science: Investigate a Dataset

This is not meant to be a professional report, nor a rigorous analysis. It's mainly a snapshot of my Python skills, with some insight into the way I think.

In this assignment, we were to choose a dataset and explore it a little. We were to compare a few variables and find some correlations.

I used the opportunity to extend my Python skills and try out some packages.

While I didn't include all of my work and exploration, be forewarned that the narrative is long and bloated.

I *casually* examined the relationships between metrics of democracy, education, and socioeconomic equity. I found some trouble differentiating these constructs. I also did not find the strength of correlations that I expected.
